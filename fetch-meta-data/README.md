Fetch Meta Data
===============

Separate scripts used to fetch metadata which is hard-coded into the repo. Requirements are
different.

`fetch_voab_info.py` will write out the vocabulary info
from [here](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/index.html) and write it out as
a CSV.
